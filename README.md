# ISA_IO_Read-Write

>Utilize an ISA bus to faciliate both reads and writes between a programmable card and a processor

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## General Outline
For this project, there will be two components. 
1. ISA Write
    >Allow the processor to set a programmable frequency by sending a calculated divisor value across the bus

2. ISA Read
    >Read data from an Analog to Digital Converter into the card that the processor can request and read into its program
